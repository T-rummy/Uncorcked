## Description

This is a web application that allows users to create an account and share their favorite wines with one another

As a collector of wines, I want to:

- track
- add
- share, collections of wines with other people.

## Project Requirements

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
